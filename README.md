Pixelite, a mobile puzzle game.

The unity project has four main scenes. The most important ones are:

gameScene: The scene for the game itself.
editScene: The scene to edit and add new levels.
generatorScene: The scene to randomly generate new levels.


The game is very simple to understand, rotate the level to drop all the white cubes, while keeping all the black cubes on the level.
